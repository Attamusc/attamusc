## Hey there!

### I'm Sean

> I go by attamusc (`atə-məsk`) pretty much everywhere

### I'm a Sr. Engineering Manager [@github](https://github.com/github)

Previously, I was an Engineering Manager [@adobe](https://github.com/adobe) on the Behance Network and Adobe Portfolio team

I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to build better interactions on the web.

When I'm not doing that, I'm spending time with my family, watching garbage TV, playing video games, or working on one of far too many abandoned side projects.
