## Hey there!

### I'm Sean

### I'm a Sr. Engineering Manager [@github](https://github.com/github)

I spend a lot of my time thinking about software and the teams that build it.

When I'm not doing that, I'm: 
- Spending time with my family
- Watching too much TV
- Playing video games
- Working on one of far too many abandoned ~rust re-writes~ side projects.

### What's an `attamusc`?

I had someone ask this recently and the explaination finally clicked. I'm reposting that here, to hopefully explain why I've stuck with this handle for so long:

> For anyone who's interacted with me, it fairly obvious I'm a giant nerd. I've watched a ton of anime, I've played a ton of games, I've read a ton of comics. That took off right around when I was 12 or 13, where I could finally pick the stuff I wanted to watch myself. There was a show that came on Adult Swim (Cartoon Networks after school/late night programming) called FLCL, that was only like 6 episodes. It was buck wild, and in-between the anime over-the-top-ness it was about a 13 year old boy come to terms with growing up and realizing he was at the point where he wasn't a kid anymore and could see that adults weren't anything more than older, tired, sometimes-broken kids. Also, there were space pirates and guitar swords and giant robots. There's a "big boss" character that everyone is searching for, who's called "Space Pirate Atomsk". I needed to come up with a name for a character in a game I was playing at the time, and decided to spell Atomsk phonetically - as close as a 13-year-old could imagine. Attamusc is what came out, and it's been my handle everywhere since.
