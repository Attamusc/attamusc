## Hey there!

### I'm Sean

### I'm a Sr. Engineering Manager [@github](https://github.com/github)

I spend a lot of my time thinking about software and the teams that build it.

When I'm not doing that, I'm: 
- Spending time with my family
- Watching too much TV
- Playing video games
- Working on one of far too many abandoned ~rust re-writes~ side projects.
